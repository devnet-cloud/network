Working with nxapi on nexus platform

1.- You need to enable nx-api feature
  Command: feature nxapi
  Command: feature bash ==> if you want to work with bash interface inside nexus

Programability is at the heart of OPEN NX-OS

NX-API REST leave CLI behind:
  - Everything in NX-OS is an OBJECT
  - Each Object have properties and methods 
  - It is much more powerful
  - More powerful that NX-API CLI but with steeper learning curve. 

Data Management Engine:
  - Provides API Acces to Management Information Tree.
    Note: Then interface with the NX-OS processes
    
  - Northbound 
      - NX-API REST
      - CLI
      - json-rpc
      - Etc
   - Southbound
       - NX-OS Processes

Management Information Tree: 
    - Object Class identify its type
    - Parent/Child relationships between object (1 parent many childrend)
    - Assembled, create the MIT
    - Everything build from "root" 
    
OBJECTS:
    - Object have two names: 
          - Relative name (RN)
              - Unique inside a parent object
          - Distinguished name (DN)
              - Unique identification inside MIT
Examples: 
- Object: System
    - RN:sys
    - DN:sys
- Object: Interface list
    - RN:intf
    - DN:sys/intf
    - Class: Interface entity
- Object: Physical Interface
    - RN: phys-[eth1/1]
    - DN: sys/intf/phys-[eth1/1]
    - Class: L1PhysIf
    
Note: https://developer.cisco.com/site/nxapi-dme-model-reference-api/
The Nexus Model Reference is a resource to help you browse data models to understand the purpose of each model, 
how to access it, and the type of data contained in it. 

NX-API REST with VISORE viewer
- Enabled with nxapi
- https://hardware/visore.html
- Navigate the object model
- Expose NX-API REST Calls

 Class based search: Is a particular type of object
  - Class for interfaces
  - Class for Vlans
    Ex: l2BD. 
  - Class for VRFs

NX-API REST URI Construction

https://Device/api/<QUERY TYPE>/<IDENTIFIER>.<FORMAT>[?<QUERY PARAMS>]
