Programability is at the heart of OPEN nx-os

Working with nxapi on nexus platform


1.- You need to enable nx-api feature
  Command: feature nxapi
  Command: feature bash ==> if you want to work with bash interface inside nexus

2.- We will have two differents frameworks

  2.1.- NX-API CLI
        - JSON-RPC (message format)
            - NOT a REST API
            - But can run over HTTP
            - Defines the REQUEST and RESPONSE format only
            - Command Type: CLI vs CLI_ascii
                  - CLI: ======================================> Prefert this one
                      - Structured data format 
                      - Simple to write code againt
                      
                  - CLI_ascii:
                      - Same output from cli command 
                      - Only good  if re-using screen scraping scripts            
            
        - INS-API (XML / JSON) (Message Format) 
            - Alternative CLI based API (specific to cisco)
            - More full features and more capabilities
            - Provides distinct show and config methods 
            - Support for sending bash commands 
            - Choice XML or JSON
            - Better error messages
            - Config Mode: cli_conf
                  - For sending configuration 
                  - Show commands work too
            - Bash Shell
                  - Sending bash commands 
                  - Requiere feature bash 
                 
  2.2.- NX-API REST (full REST access)
        - DME (Data Management Engine)
        - Management Information Tree
        
        
3.-NX-API Developper Sandbox (Is a web page hosted on every nx-os device) 
      - Enable along with NX-API
      - Web page hosted on box
      - Constructs API Calls from CLIs
      - Python script templates 
      - Best for NX-API CLI
      
4.- Developer Sandbox with POSTMAN
Note: NX-API CLI operates over HTTP BUT it is NOT REST
    - URL to target: htpps://device/ins
    - Header to use:
        - Content type: applicatyion/json-rpc
        - Content type: application/json 
        - Content type: application/xml 
    - Method: POST
    - Authentication:
        - Basic
        - Cookies
        
5.- NX-API CLI Authentication and Cookies
    - Most web clients automatically maintein sessions cookies
    - Basic Authorization not required 
    - Use of authorization cookies recommended to reduce load on switch
